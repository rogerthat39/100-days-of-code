# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 75: 6 February 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the rest of the ES6 module on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts** Starting to feel a bit unmotivated/burnt out. It's getting hard to continue after the first hour of work.
