# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 24 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first two Python modules on the SoloLearn app. The concepts aren't new, but it's good to get a refresher on the syntax and how python works.

**Thoughts:** This is actually the first day of my holidays. I worked out that I had just under 100 days until I start back at uni, so what better way to make sure my programming skills stay sharp than to set myself a personal challenge to code 1h per day until then? I might not be working on a personal project <i>every</i> day of that time like the rules say, but I do plan to try out some things I've been meaning to do for a while now, and this is for me anyway. If nothing else, this'll give me some semblance of routine for the summer break.


## Day 2: 25 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the next two SoloLearn modules - methods and File I/O.

**Thoughts:** Not too hard to understand, since I've done file I/O in C#. It's funny thinking back to when I first started Python in high school - I had no idea that file I/O was possible. Absolutely blew my mind to realize you could save data and use it after the program has closed.


## Day 3: 26 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the next two SoloLearn modules - 'more types' and 'functional programming'.

**Thoughts:** Gonna need to practise this lot in order for it to stick since this is definitely not revision. Not a lot of time today since I was out and about.


## Day 4: 27 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Experimenting with file I/O and the itertools library. Also converted the practical exam from C# into python (aside from the GUI) which was a fairly simple I/O program that held 10 lines of data and a single button.

**Thoughts:** Took me 15 minutes to write the practical exam at the time, and probably 20 minutes to write the python version. It definitely helped that that .split(',') was in both languages.


## Day 5: 28 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Converted Lab 10 into Python - which involved searching, sorting, and classes.

**Thoughts:** I think that python works like JavaScript where if you cay object2 = object1, it doesn't create a copy, just another name that points to the same location in memory. So in actuality, there's one object that both names are referencing.


## Day 6: 29 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the OOP and regex modules in SoloLearn.

**Thoughts:** Some of today's material went a bit fast for me, so I'm going to have to seek out different explanations/exercises to get a better understanding of the concepts.


## Day 7: 30 November, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read about classes/objects in Python, and completed some [exercises](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/), since I realized that I don't remember much of how to do them.


## Day 8: 1 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Found some Python [regular expression exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/re/) to do, and got stuck on #20. 

**Thoughts:** For some reason it's not always working as I'd expect. Should the regex always starts the search from the beginning of the string, even when ^ is not specified? Do I need to use boundaries instead?


## Day 9: 2 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fixed the issue from yesterday, then continued with the rest of the regex exercises. Also completed the final SoloLearn module and test, gaining the certificate.

**Thoughts:** It's strange getting a certificate for programming! But I'm pleased with how I went. I still have a lot to learn about Python; this is only the first step.

**Link:** [Certificate](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1073-11756375/pdf/)


## Day 10: 3 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Converted a C# assessment from school into Python. It's a math program that comes up with an equation and takes input for the answer, and lets you know if you got the answer right or not.


## Day 11: 4 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started converting yesterday's school project into a GUI (using tkinter). The original C# application did have pictures and labels, so I'll try to get it to look as close to the original as possible.

**Thoughts:** At the moment, the output prints to the console, and the images aren't up yet. I forgot how to update labels and images like that, so I'll have to find my notes from way back when before tomorrow.


## Day 12: 5 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got the images to work, message box to pop up, and changed the design to look more like it did in C#.

**Thoughts:** Project 1 is now completed! It was certainly easier to do in C#, but there's something about coming back to your first programming language. It's good to keep up the practise, in any case.


## Day 13: 6 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the GUI for the taxes program (project 2 of the school assignment).

**Thoughts:** It was difficult to do even an hour after a long day, but I managed it and it's a good feeling.


## Day 14: 7 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got the first screen functional and working for the taxes program. 

**Thoughts:** The code looks super long at this point, but it's mostly just creating and displaying widgets.


## Day 15: 8 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Figured out how to switch between screens/tabs, put the new widgets in but no functionality yet. 

**Thoughts:** The code looks super long at this point, but it's mostly just creating and displaying widgets.


## Day 16: 9 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished functionality for the second tab of the taxes program.

**Thoughts:** Trying to make it look exactly the same as in C#, where you can drag and drop objects and they don't have to be in a grid, is borderline impossible. I think I managed to get it to look alright though.


## Day 17: 10 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Found a free course on Codecademy for [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) - albiet an outdated form, but most of it should still be relevant.

**Thoughts:** It's strange not using brackets for print statements though.


## Day 18: 11 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the [Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) lessons, now up to 47%.


## Day 19: 12 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Up to 78% in [Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course. Made a calendar program which isn't nearly as cool as it sounds, but it filled in the day.

**Thoughts:** Just discovered the quizzes and side projects. That's probably why the % jumped up so much compared to yesterday.


## Day 20: 13 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did more projects in [Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python), but didn't quite finish. Up to 94% completion.

**Thoughts:** A car crashed into the power box down the road and caused a power cut. I worked until I ran out of battery on my laptop.


## Day 21: 14 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the [Python 2](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course, and 43% of the way through the [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) course.

**Thoughts:** Just discovered that I have a pro membership going, so I can do pro courses?? Not sure how, since I didn't pay for one. I guess this is a free trial? Either way, gonna try to make the most of this.


## Day 22: 15 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the [Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) course.

**Thoughts:** A lot of this was revision from things done previously, but the quizzes were worthwhile and there was a few new things sprinkled in there. Only two days left of the pro trial, going to try to get as many pro courses under my belt as possible.


## Day 23: 16 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished two courses, [Python Recursion](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-recursion-python) and [Natural Language Processing](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/natural-language-processing)

**Thoughts:** Some parts of both courses went a little over my head, but it was interesting to see what people can really do with Python and things like the bag-of-words model.


## Day 24: 17 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the [Pandas](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/data-processing-pandas) Codecademy course

**Thoughts:** My free trial runs out today, so I probably won't be able to finish the course.


## Day 25: 18 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did two CoderByte challenges - finding the [longest word](https://www.coderbyte.com/language/Longest%20Word) in a sentence, and a simple [message scrambler](https://www.coderbyte.com/language/Letter%20Changes).


## Day 26: 19 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did [three](https://www.coderbyte.com/language/Simple%20Symbols) [more](https://www.coderbyte.com/language/Letter%20Capitalize) [challenges](https://www.coderbyte.com/language/Simple%20Adding) from the website CoderByte.


## Day 27: 20 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Planned and started a skip-bo program in Python.

**Thoughts:** Skip-Bo is a card game for 2-4 players that I used to play as a kid. We used to play the "quick" version which means each player got 10 stock cards and not 20, which isn't technically how the game is played, but it was fun for us, so that's how I'm going to make my program. The rules and terms are found [here](https://howdoyouplayit.com/play-skip-bo-rules-skip-bo-card/) (although I called my draw pile a pickUpPile)


## Day 28: 21 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fixed the drawCards function, which for some reason wouldn't let me put an empty list as the default value for a variable, so some calls of that function will need an empty list as a parameter.


## Day 29: 22 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed functionality for ending the player's turn and putting out a card from the hand to the discard pile

**Thoughts:** It's quite easy to get stuck in an unescapable loop if you hit the wrong key and you don't have any cards to use for that, (like saying you're going to put out a card but you have no cards that can go on any discard piles) so there needs to be some escape key so you can go back to the main decision. I chose X, as it's unlikely to be used in the future for anything.


## Day 30: 23 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed functions for putting out a card to the building pile from the hand and from the discard pile.

**Thoughts:** Almost done with the Player class - just need to be able to put cards back into the pickUpPile once the building pile reaches 12 and is reset.


## Day 31: 24 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fully functional now, time for gameplay testing against myself. Also added a function that gets the top card from a building pile, to make things easier with putting out cards.

**Thoughts:** It's amazing how many little tweaks are needed even after you thought you tested the code. Goes to show that having a plan for testing is super important. Or even just playing through a game to the end.


## Day 32: 25 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did some more gameplay testing and fixed a bug with the win condition.

**Thoughts:** The first time the code has ended (that hasn't been an error - it was a win screen!) happened to be on Christmas Day, go figure. Feels like a Christmas present from the coding gods


## Day 33: 26 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the computer player class which will have decisions rather than input from the player.

**Thoughts:** The decisions I'm putting in are what I would do in various situations. For example, check whether the stock card can be put out first.


## Day 34: 27 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued work on the computer player functions and priorities.

**Thoughts:** Putting out cards from the hand and the discard pile seem to have a lot of repeating code. Once this class is working, I should go back and get rid of these redundant parts by creating functions that are written once and can be called from different places in the code.


## Day 35: 28 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started the endTurn function, which runs when the computer player can't put out any more cards and has to end their turn by putting a card from their hand to the discard pile. It didn't work right at first, but seems to be all right now.

**Thoughts:** The first part of this decision is: if any discard piles contain only one number (there may be more than one card in that pile), check the hand for that number. If the number is in the hand, that is the card that should be discarded.


## Day 36: 29 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed the endTurn function with a few decisions that impact which card to choose and what discard pile it ends up on.

**Thoughts:** The second decision is if there is an empty pile. If there is, and the hand contains more than one card the same, the player should put one of those out into the empty pile. Otherwise, a random card should be put out onto the empty pile. The third decision is the default - if there is no empty pile, is to put out a random card to a random pile.


## Day 37: 30 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Fixing small bugs in how the output displays (with spaces in between certain lines), and started planning for an algorithm that will check if the stock card can be put out with help from cards in the computer player's hand and discard pile.


## Day 38: 31 December, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Short break from the skip-bo program - did a couple of Reddit dailyprogrammer challenges ([checksum](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/a72sdj/20181217_challenge_370_easy_upc_check_digits/) and [hex colors](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/a0lhxx/20181126_challenge_369_easy_hex_colors/)).

**Thoughts:** The bonus part of the hex colors challenge, the color blending, was quite interesting in terms of color theory. It takes two hex colors and finds the middle value of those (ie. mixes those two colors together)


## Day 39: 1 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started a function called canStockCardBeReached, that will decide if the computer can put out the stock card, using the cards in their hand and discard pile.

**Thoughts:** It's important for the player to put out the stock card first if they can, because then they can decide what to do next based on the next card to be turned up. If the computer is allowed to randomly put out any card they can instead of going straight for the stock card, they might put down a card that is the same as the next card in the stock pile (that they can't see), which would make them unable to put out that card when the time comes. It sounds complicated and that's probably because I haven't explained it very well, but it's something a human player would do without really thinking about it.


## Day 40: 2 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** canStockCardBeReached appears to be working for the most part, but it's buggy and needs more testing.

**Thoughts:** Already I can see some problems I don't know how to overcome. How do you explain in code that in a hand with three 1's and a W on the stock pile, that putting out a 1 then a W is better than making the W a 1? Maybe I need another function that "maximizes" the potential number of cards that can be put out (based on hand, discard piles, building piles) so that no matter what the new stock card is, it is likely to be able to be put out based on those actions. But I have no idea how to go about doing this.


## Day 41: 3 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More testing, and cleaning up the code (writing comments)

**Thoughts:** I guess it's a good sign if the computer is beating me the majority of the time? I wasn't expecting the algorithm to be that good yet. Although since it's a card game, maybe it depends on luck more than anything. I wonder if I should try to improve the computer's decisions like I was planning to, since surely it isn't that fun to play a computer that relentlessly pounds the user into the dust each time. It's supposed to be for the player's benefit, so they should be able to win some/most of the time due to their own skill.


## Day 42: 4 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Changed checkHand to a class function (with no parameters except self), and now starting to get rid of repeating code from the player and computerPlayer classes.

**Thoughts:** Currently at 563 lines of code (including comments), aiming to reduce this number. Hopefully the code won't become unreadable now that I'm adding new functions.


## Day 43: 5 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Hit a bit of a road block with the "put out card from discard pile" function. For some reason, it says it's putting out one card, but a different card is actually put out.

**Thoughts:** A bit of a bummer not to get that much work done. Going to look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow.


## Day 44: 6 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Fixed the bug - it was in the original logic (not something I just changed), where the computer would always put out the card from the first discard pile (if the card came from a discard pile).

**Thoughts:** I suspect that I copied code from the "from hand" part of the function and didn't check it properly. Serves me right for copying code instead of making one function that does both.


## Day 45: 7 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished putOutCardFromHand function

**Thoughts:** No notable incidents or anything. Seemed almost peaceful - it's weird not getting any errors.


## Day 46: 8 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Changed the way pickUpPile works - [random.shuffle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/976882/shuffling-a-list-of-objects) runs at the start of the game and players then take the top card each time they fill up their hand. Also, created an intermediate function in canStockCardBeReached called createPath, which also takes cases where the pile has to run past 12 to put out the stockCard.

**Thoughts:** I forgot I had that link saved - it's a much simpler solution than picking a random card from the list each time. I'd like to think that only calling a random function once (as opposed to each time someone wants a card) makes the program run faster.


## Day 47: 9 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** General tidying of code, adding comments to make it more readable, and added a new step to computer endTurn when deciding where to put a card.

**Thoughts:** Not sure what else I could do at this point to improve the code? The new step was to tell the computer to try to put a card on a pile with only 1 other card on it before devolving to 'guess I'll pick a random card to go anywhere' since there could be a pile with lots of the same card that you don't want to block off unnecessarily.


## Day 48: 10 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Changed tryDiscardPile to be more efficient, and started the JS SoloLearn course. Was able to skip ahead to the Objects module since I already knew a bit of JS from last year.

**Thoughts:** There's probably a lot more I could do to improve this Skip-Bo program, but I'm not too sure where to go from here. What I probably should have done was planned out how I was going to do it instead of jumping right in (which felt good at the time!) since I'm now left with ~500 lines of code that could probably be organized and structured better, but at this point that's such a daunting task that I don't know how to start, and I don't really know too much about coding best practises to want to attempt that right now. Plus, the next step after that is most likely to move to a GUI, which would either involve me learning pygame, or moving the code to C#, which I'm not quite ready to do yet. I'm happy to leave this text-based version as tentatively finished, and take a break to work on something else for a while.


## Day 49: 11 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Did the next two JS SoloLearn modules ('Core Objects' and 'DOM & Events') and finished off the first two chapters of FreeCodeCamp (that I hadn't done from three years ago apparently).

**Thoughts:** Learnt about Bezier curves in CSS, Array methods in JS, the Math Object, and the Document Object Model. An interesting coincidence that the last time I logged in to FreeCodeCamp was exactly three years ago - 11 Feb 2016.


## Day 50: 12 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started learning p5.js from a YouTube tutorial called The Coding Train, and drew a cat whose eyes grow and shrink depending on where the mouse is hovering.

**Thoughts:** It was fun to mess around like this, and it's always worth creating something unique instead of following a tutorial directly. Also, I'm halfway there already!! I feel like I will be able to do this

**Link to work:** [Cat Eyes project](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/EGGoyL)


## Day 51: 13 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continuing from yesterday, gave the cat a mouth, nose, and stripes.

**Thoughts:** I'm kinda impressed with how good this looks for a slapdash of shapes and only one moving part.

**Link to work:** [Cat Eyes project](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/EGGoyL)


## Day 52: 14 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Made a ball bounce around the screen using p5.js, taking inspiration from a tutorial from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO3Awjn_gyU) on YouTube.

**Thoughts:** It reminds me of the old DVD screensavers. It's pretty relaxing to look at.

**Link to work:** [Bouncing Ball](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/pGdLyd)


## Day 53: 15 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Found an interesting website called Advent of Code, which supplies Christmas-themed puzzles one day at a time throughout December. Obviously I'm a bit late (it being mid-January) but all the challenges are still up, for every year since 2015. I completed the two [Day 1 puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1) for 2018.

**Thoughts:** The first puzzle was straightforward enough, but the second stalled for so long that I thought it was broken. Nope, it was working, just really slowly. In other words, part of the puzzle was optimizing the algorithm so that it works for large inputs. I ended up looking at the Reddit page for help with making the program more efficient.


## Day 54: 16 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Did four puzzles today, both of [Day 2's](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2) and both of [Day 3's](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3)! And completed the FreeCodeCamp [Applied Visual Design](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design) module.

**Thoughts:** I found these puzzles easier than yesterday, probably since none of them needed to be optomized. They were certainly different to anything I've done before, though, and I enjoyed the challenge.


## Day 55: 17 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished both Advent of Code [Day 4 puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4), using Python and regex. It runs surprisingly quickly for the amount of data given.

**Thoughts:** Spent a while debugging a silly error I introduced while trying to make the program more efficient prematurely, so didn't get as many done as yesterday. I still felt accomplished after getting this far, though. I'm also very thankful for Python's .sort function, as the puzzle would've been much harder without it!


## Day 56: 18 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished both [Day 5 puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5), then looked on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a3912m/2018_day_5_solutions/) for how I could have approached the problem differently. 

**Thoughts:** My algorithms both worked, but clearly aren't optimized, as it takes at least 10 minutes to get an answer (for the first one - it has to run x26 for the second). I ended up stopping it for the second puzzle after it reached a number that was clearly lower than any others I'd gotten so far, tried it, and it ended up being correct. Looking at other answers showed that I was calling the function way too many times - each time I found a match and got rid of it, I'd start the entire loop again and start comparing from the beginning! No wonder it took so long. It would have been much better to stay in the same place in the polymer, and compare the letters before and after the pointer, since no combinations could have spontaneously appeared where the reaction had not taken place.


## Day 57: 19 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Got stuck on the [Day 6 puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/6) (first puzzle). Instead, I completed the FreeCodeCamp [Accessibility module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility).

**Thoughts:** The puzzle concerns something I'm not familiar with and couldn't get my head around in a day ([Taxicab Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)). A bit of a shame since I was really enjoying them, so perhaps I'll come back to it some other day, once I've brushed up on high school trig.


## Day 58: 20 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Did the FreeCodeCamp [Responsive Web Design](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-principles) module.

**Thoughts:** Since this module was quite short, I spent the rest of the time looking up terms I didn't understand, and looking for other resources about accessibility on the web.


## Day 59: 21 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Did the last SoloLearn JS module about ECMAScript 6, which means I've completed the course.

**Thoughts:** Was away from my computer for most of the day, so I worked on the SoloLearn app.

**Link:** [Certificate](https://www.sololearn.com/Certificate/1024-11756375/pdf/)


## Day 60: 22 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the [CSS Flexbox](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox) and [CSS Grid](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/css-grid) modules.

**Thoughts:** The CSS Grid stuff was revision, but I hadn't learnt Flexbox before. I was expecting it to be much more complicated, but I might actually prefer it to Grid.


## Day 61: 23 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the first FreeCodeCamp project - a tribute page about a ship cat that survived three of his ships sinking.

**Thoughts:** Whoever looks at my codepen account at this point is going to think I'm a cat fanatic, lol.

**Link to work:** [Tribute page](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/vbEjLw)


## Day 62: 24 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed a survey page about breakfast food (must've been hungry when I thought of the topic).

**Thoughts:** I had to look up a few things, but mostly it was done from memory. Hopefully with more practise I'll be able to do it faster and without having to look online.

**Link to work:** [Survey page](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/ZwGjxb)


## Day 63: 25 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started a landing page, not sure what to make the subject yet. I've started the layout for now, can think of a subject later.

**Thoughts:** There's a glitch in the nav bar where the image and the links (which are in an unordered list) have a gap between them. I've spent most of the day trying to get rid of it, but so far unsuccessful.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/wNMweo)


## Day 64: 26 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the landing page, and figured out what the glitch was almost immediately. I hadn't set the padding and margins of the \<ul> element to 0, hence the gap between the img and links, but not between the links themselves. I spent the whole time thinking it was the img's fault.

**Thoughts:** I guess it can be beneficial to step away from a problem for a while/sleep on it lmao.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/wNMweo)


## Day 65: 27 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed a landing page, decided to make it about ball-point pens, in honour of the hiring managers that pull a pen out of their pockets and ask you to sell it back to them.

**Thoughts:** Spent a while on the media queries, trying to get the three product divs to look nice no matter what the device size was. Definitely opened my eyes to how different a website can look depending on the browser width.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/wNMweo)


## Day 66: 28 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the functionality for the personal portfolio, still have to do the layout and make it look nice.

**Thoughts:** Dabbled a bit in color palettes as well, but wow is it hard to pick a color. I was staring at a color wheel for a while thinking about which one I should start with. Graphic designers, you have my respect.

**Link to work:** [Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/rogerthat35/pen/QYEjjM)


## Day 67: 29 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Mostly done with the styling, spent a lot of time wondering why the flex property wouldn't apply to the nav bar and make the links right-aligned. Turns out the flex property was being applied, I just hadn't made the width 100vh which was why it didn't go all the way across the screen.

**Thoughts:** Probably would've completely finished today, but it was getting late and the light was starting to attract a colony of bugs. I looked up and went "well, guess I'm doing this tomorrow" and got out of there as quickly as possible.

## Day 68: 30 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the portfolio page, and played a couple of interesting games intended to help learn [CSS Grid](http://cssgridgarden.com/) and [Flexbox](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

**Thoughts:** There aren't a lot of projects I have right now that I'm that... proud of? I know I'm still fairly new at this, but I feel the urge to do something more complex. Perhaps I should come back to these early projects later once I know more and spruce them up a bit.

## Day 69: 31 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started a codepen using p5.js of a cat's tail swinging. I didn't get that far - it's just a line swinging at the moment - I had to look up the formula y = x^2 and then play with numbers that would make the line appear on the screen.

**Thoughts:** Didn't realize I'd forgotton so much since high school.

## Day 70: 1 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Got half of the tail tip working - I want it to curl up at the top of the swing, and uncurl while going back down again. Mostly it's a case of trial and error.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully the other half will just be a case of flipping some numbers around. It's quite funny when the numbers aren't quite right and the tip of the tail goes haywire.

## Day 71: 2 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the other half of the swing. It doesn't quite look right, but the tail tip is at least attached now and not in the void.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm going to abandon this project since it probably isn't possible to do quite what I'm intending. I could tweak the numbers so that it doesn't appear to "jump" between states, but even then I don't think I'll be fully happy with it. Tomorrow I'm planning on starting the last freecodecamp project I need to get the certificate.

## Day 72: 3 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the technical documentation page (based on some things I learned about C#) and got the certificate!

**Thoughts:** Very happy and proud of myself. I was putting off this project since I thought it was the hardest one, but after sitting down and working through it, the difficult parts didn't seem as daunting. It's nice to have something tangible that represents my accomplishments.

## Day 73: 4 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the [Basic JavaScript module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript) from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** Onto the next certificate! This was all familiar, since I learnt a bit of JavaScript last year before starting this challenge. Doing all 107 exercises tired me out, though.


## Day 74: 5 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started on the FreeCodeCamp [ES6 module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6), learning about the spread operator and destructuring assignment.

**Thoughts:** This is a lot different from anything I've done before in JS, syntax-wise. I'm going to have to look up some other explanations for it to sink in.


## Day 75: 6 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the rest of the [ES6 module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel a bit unmotivated/burnt out. It's getting hard to continue after the first hour of work.


## Day 76: 7 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished [Regular Expressions FreeCodeCamp module](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions).

**Thoughts:** Finally got around to learning how GitHub works and forking the 100DaysOfCode repo to write about my journey publically. I wasn't originally going to do this, since I have my own journals I write in every day, but Git is a valuable skill to learn, and I was just putting it off. So if anyone noticed the start date of the 100DaysOfCode was before the start date of this account, that's why. I should also move some of the projects I worked on over here.

## Day 77: 8 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the [FreeCodeCamp debugging](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging) module at about 1am. That still counts as today right? I'm so tired.

**Thoughts:** I did a lot of typing yesterday, and now my left hand is sore. It's probably because the 'm' key is broken on my keyboard, and I was copy pasting that letter each time I needed it, which probably isn't the direction you're hand is supposed to move too often. Gonna have to look after my physical body too, especially making a career out of this.


## Day 78: 9 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Got about half way through the FreeCodeCamp [Data Structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures) module.

**Thoughts:** The internet cut out, and I was having trouble, so I decided this would be a good stopping point. A little unsatisfying but so is learning syntax. Hopefully this will look better tomorrow.


## Day 79: 10 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the [Data Structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures) module and started [Basic Algorithms](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting)

**Thoughts:** The reason I was stuck yesterday was I fotgot what key value pairs were. So I was trying to access the thing like a nested object, when I needed to access the value as obj[name] instead.


## Day 80: 11 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the rest of the FreeCodeCamp [Basic Algorithm](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting) module. 

**Thoughts:** JavaScript can be hard to debug - especially nested arrays, because they display without the [ ] brackets? So it's hard to see if it's working as intended when you console.log() it, since all the data appears one after the other no matter how many 'levels in' each bit is. Also sometimes it'll just break and not give you an error message :(


## Day 81: 12 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the FreeCodeCamp [Object Oriented Programming](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming) module.

**Thoughts:** I would have been really confused if I had tried this module even last year. It's nice being able to relate back to stuff I've done before, and learn new parts to those ideas that further solidify my understanding of them.


## Day 82: 13 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Did a little side project - a memory matching card game where you try to match two cards

**Thoughts:** If it weren't for user Barmar on this [StackOverFlow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18638109/event-listener-running-function-before-the-element-is-clicked-in-chrome-extensio), I would've been stuck for ages wondering why my function call didn't work. Otherwise, it was pretty fun working out how to get the program working.

## Day 83: 14 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started [Functional Programming](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming) module

**Thoughts:** As I understand it, you can parse in a function to another function by omitting the brackets? Which is different from calling the function, which does include the brackets eg. function(). Yesterday's project makes so much more sense now.


## Day 84: 15 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the [Functional Programming](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/functional-programming) module.

**Thoughts:** Learning about the map function (and filter) and then <i>creating my own one</i> is wild to me. Not sure if I quite got my head around reduce though. I feel like I've learnt a lot even over the past couple of days


## Day 85: 16 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started the [Intermediate Algorithm](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting) FreeCodeCamp module.

**Thoughts:** Some of these problems are quite difficult. I'm probably going to have to take a few days to complete this one, which is good, since it means it's really stretching the limits of what I'm able to do!


## Day 86: 17 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the [Intermediate Algorithm](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting) FreeCodeCamp module.

**Thoughts:** This is taking a bit longer than I thought it was going to. I've been creating my own solution for each exercise, making sure it works, and then looking at what other people have tried and discovering that there are multiple better ways of doing it. Hopefully reading and understanding the other solutions will allow me to write better code next time?


## Day 89: 18 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continuing on with the [Intermediate Algorithm](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting) module, I went back to a couple of activities I had skipped and gave them another go.

**Thoughts:** While in one case it involved deleting half of it and starting over, it was great to finish something I was struggling with and didn't know how to do.
