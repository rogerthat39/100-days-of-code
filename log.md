# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 62: 24 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed a survey page about breakfast food (must've been hungry when I thought of the topic).

**Thoughts:** I had to look up a few things, but mostly it was done from memory. Hopefully with more practise I'll be able to do it faster and without having to look online.

## Day 63: 25 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started a landing page, not sure what to make the subject yet. I've started the layout for now, can think of a subject later.

**Thoughts:** There's a glitch in the nav bar where the image and the links (which are in an unordered list) have a gap between them. I've spent most of the day trying to get rid of it, but so far unsuccessful.

## Day 64: 26 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the landing page, and figured out what the glitch was almost immediately. I hadn't set the padding and margins of the <ul> element to 0, hence the gap between the img and links, but not between the links themselves. I spent the whole time thinking it was the img's fault.

**Thoughts:** I guess it can be beneficial to step away from a problem for a while/sleep on it lmao.

## Day 65: 27 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed a landing page, decided to make it about ball-point pens, in honour of the hiring managers that pull a pen out of their pockets and ask you to sell it back to them.

**Thoughts:** Spent a while on the media queries, trying to get the three product divs to look nice no matter what the device size was. Definitely opened my eyes to how different a website can look depending on the browser width.

## Day 66: 28 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the functionality for the personal portfolio, still have to do the layout and make it look nice.

**Thoughts:** Dabbled a bit in color palettes as well, but wow is it hard to pick a color. I was staring at a color wheel for a while thinking about which one I should start with. Graphic designers, you have my respect.

### Day 67: 29 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Mostly done with the styling, spent a lot of time wondering why the flex property wouldn't apply to the nav bar and make the links right-aligned. Turns out the flex property was being applied, I just hadn't made the width 100vh which was why it didn't go all the way across the screen.

**Thoughts:** Probably would've completely finished today, but it was getting late and the light was starting to attract a colony of bugs. I looked up and went "well, guess I'm doing this tomorrow" and got out of there as quickly as possible.

### Day 68: 30 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the portfolio page, and played a couple of interesting games intended to help learn CSS Grid and FlexBox.

**Thoughts:** There aren't a lot of projects I have right now that I'm that... proud of? I know I'm still fairly new at this, but I feel the urge to do something more complex. Perhaps I should come back to these early projects later once I know more and spruce them up a bit.

### Day 69: 31 January, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started a codepen using p5.js of a cat's tail swinging. I didn't get that far - it's just a line swinging at the moment - I had to look up the formula y = x^2 and then play with numbers that would make the line appear on the screen.

**Thoughts:** Didn't realize I'd forgotton so much since high school.

### Day 70: 1 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Got half of the tail tip working - I want it to curl up at the top of the swing, and uncurl while going back down again. Mostly it's a case of trial and error.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully the other half will just be a case of flipping some numbers around. It's quite funny when the numbers aren't quite right and the tip of the tail goes haywire.

### Day 71: 2 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the other half of the swing. It doesn't quite look right, but the tail tip is at least attached now and not in the void.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm going to abandon this project since it probably isn't possible to do quite what I'm intending. I could tweak the numbers so that it doesn't appear to "jump" between states, but even then I don't think I'll be fully happy with it. Tomorrow I'm planning on starting the last freecodecamp project I need to get the certificate.

### Day 72: 3 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the technical documentation page (based on some things I learned about C#) and got the certificate!

**Thoughts:** Very happy and proud of myself. I was putting off this project since I thought it was the hardest one, but after sitting down and working through it, the difficult parts didn't seem as daunting. It's nice to have something tangible that represents my accomplishments.

### Day 73: 4 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Basic JavaScript module from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** Onto the next certificate! This was all familiar, since I learnt a bit of JavaScript last year before starting this challenge. Doing all 107 exercises tired me out, though.

### Day 74: 5 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started on the ES6 module, learning about the spread operator and destructuring assignment.

**Thoughts:** This is a lot different from anything I've done before in JS, syntax-wise. I'm going to have to look up some other explanations for it to sink in.

### Day 75: 6 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished the rest of the ES6 module on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** Starting to feel a bit unmotivated/burnt out. It's getting hard to continue after the first hour of work.

### Day 76: 7 February, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

**Thoughts:** Finally got around to learning how GitHub works and forking the 100DaysOfCode repo to write about my journey publically. I wasn't originally going to do this, since I have my own journals I write in every day, but Git is a valuable skill to learn, and I was just putting it off. So if anyone noticed the start date of the 100DaysOfCode was before the start date of this account, that's why. I should also move some of the projects I worked on over here.
